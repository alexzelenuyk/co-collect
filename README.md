# Co-collect App

## Motivation

Recently in Germany were introduced some temporary restrictions, where owners of Restaurants, Bars, Barbershops etc. 
are obligatory to *collect* visitors information. 
This aims to keep track off contacts and can potentially help to localize spread of virus *Co*vid-19.

This Proof of concept shows, how to automate process of collecting personal information by contactless scanning and generating QR codes.
